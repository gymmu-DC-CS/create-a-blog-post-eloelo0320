    <h1>The family of Eric Cartman</h1>
    <div class="liane">
      <h2>Mother</h2>
      <p>
        Eric Cartman lives with his mother Liane Cartman. She is a single mom
        and doesn't have much money. She loves her son very much but still gets
        tired of him sometimes
      </p>

      <h2>Father</h2>
      <p>
        As we find out later in the series, Eric's father is noone other than
        Jack Tenorman. This character appears and also dies in season five. His
        death is Cartman's fault, who at the time didn't know it was his father
        and seeked revenge on a fellow student, Scott Tenorman.

      <h2>Half-brother</h2>
      <p>
        Lastly we have Erics parental half-brother, Scott Tenorman. In the
        episode 'Scott Tenorman must die' Eric makes Scott eat his parents,
        because he has played a prank on him. That makes Scott hate Cartman and
        leads to Scott finding out about Jack being Erics father.
