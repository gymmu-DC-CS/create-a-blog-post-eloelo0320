    <p>The characters, that mostly hang out with Cartman are the other main characters of South Park - Stan, Kyle and Kenny. </p>Â¨
    <p>Stan Marsh</p>
    <p>Stan doesn't really consider Cartman a friend. They never hang out alone and always with the rest of the group. However you can clearly see, that Stan does not hate Cartman as much as for example Kyle does.</p>
